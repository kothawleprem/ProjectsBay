- Detailed Explanation of the Idea : "The old-style resume is dead; projects should speak for you." 
Certifications help, but need to be verified with practical experience! For young technologists, it's time to bury those resume templates and get their hands "dirty" right from college, work on projects etc. And make these as the centrepiece of your resume.  - Times of India. <br/>
